# RPG Game
In this exercise, you will develop a hero RPG (*Role Playing Game*) using all of the cool new python knowledge you've acquired. This game will be created using **Object Oriented Programming**.

The game starts off with 2 characters: a `hero` and a `goblin`. Each character will be given a starting health and starting value. 

Each character also has a power that can be used to attack their opponent. In the initial scenario, the `hero's` opponent is the `goblin`, and the `goblin's` opponent is the `hero`.

When either character attacks his/her opponent, the opponent's health will decrease by the amount of power of the attacking character.

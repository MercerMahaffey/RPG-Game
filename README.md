# RPG Game
In this exercise, you will develop a hero RPG (*Role Playing Game*) using all of the cool new python knowledge you've acquired. This game will be created using **Object Oriented Programming**.

The game starts off with 2 characters: a `hero` and a `goblin`. Each character will be given a starting health and starting value. 

Each character also has a power that can be used to attack their opponent. In the initial scenario, the `hero's` opponent is the `goblin`, and the `goblin's` opponent is the `hero`.

When either character attacks his/her opponent, the opponent's health will decrease by the amount of power of the attacking character.

This is a solo project I completed over a weekend which was intended to teach object oriented programming. I finished the project and then decided to make the 
game 2D. This was very early on in my progress towards learning to program (about 2 weeks in) and I wanted to challenge myself to not use any outside resources when
designing the 2D board or the way the board prints out, so the 2D conversion of the project was only using what I could think of.
